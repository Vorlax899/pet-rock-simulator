Virtual Pet Rock Simulator

This is a small Python console project made just for fun. The idea is simple: you have a virtual pet rock that reacts to how you are feeling. Based on your mood, the rock responds in its own quiet way and sometimes randomly changes its personality.

There is no goal to win or lose. It is just an interactive program to practice basic Python concepts like classes, user input, conditionals, and randomness.

Features
- Mood-based reactions from the pet rock
- Random personality changes
- Multiple personalities such as chill, grumpy, wise, lazy, energetic, and mysterious
- Very lightweight and beginner-friendly
- Runs entirely in the terminal

How it works
- You give your pet rock a name
- You enter your current mood (happy, sad, angry, tired, excited)
- The rock reacts to your mood
- Occasionally, the rock’s personality changes on its own
- The program keeps running until you type "quit"

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required

How to run
1. Save the code in a file named pet_rock.py
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Run the program using:
   python pet_rock.py

Purpose
This project is meant for learning and experimentation. It helps beginners understand how simple logic, randomness, and classes work together in Python.
